The increase in the number of unwanted emails known as spam has produced a need for the development of more reliable and effective anti-spam filters. 
Recently, machine learning algorithms have been effectively utilised to detect and filter spam emails. 
In the field of natural language processing, there are numerous algorithms available for this kind of classification. 
Typically, spam emails contain a few recognisable terms that are pretty obvious indicators that the email is spam.

   
   we will go through the processing of the data, exploring the data and applying the algorithms to find and compare the efficiency of several machine learning techniques such as
   
1 .KNN ,
2 Random Forest,
3 Naive Bayes,
4 SVM,
5 Logistic Regression  and more approaches. 
 

 
 A collection of data consisting of around 60,000 emails including both authentic and spam emails was utilised in this investigation.
 These strategies are also thoroughly compared in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
